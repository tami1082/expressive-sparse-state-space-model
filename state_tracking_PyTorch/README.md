# 📊 Experimental Results: Length Generalization on FSA State Tracking

This submodule contains the code for reproducing the PD-SSM results in Table 2 from the paper, shown below.

## Environment

The base environment only consists of a few packages.

```
conda create -n pdssm_pytorch python=3.10
conda activate pdssm_pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Experiments

### Reproduce Experiments

The PD-SSM experiment configurations are saved in JSON format in ```./experiment_configs```. 
Each JSON config file corresponds to a task-seed combination.
For example, to train PD-SSM on parity with the seed 2, execute the following command:

```
python run_experiment.py -c parity_2
```

#### Transition variants for FSA ablations

To contrast symbol-dependent permutations against purely diagonal dynamics, set
`transition_type` inside a config JSON:

* `"pd"` (default): learn both permutation dictionary selections and input-dependent diagonals.
* `"perm_only"`: force a unit diagonal so only the symbol-conditioned permutation dictionary drives the recurrence.
* `"diag_only"`: replace the permutation with an identity matrix so only the input-dependent diagonal carries state.

These options help recreate the ablations discussed in the paper—showing that rich permutations alone can solve regular tasks and length-generalize, while diagonals without permutations struggle on parity/mod/group.

The checkpoints are stored in ```./checkpoints``` and the results are stored in ```./results```.

To analyse the results, execute the following command which prints the best validation accuracy for each task/seed combination in ```./results```:

```
python analyse_results.py
```

### Implementation details

This submodule is implemented in PyTorch, with the PD-SSM model implemented in a fully recurrent way, treating the column-sparse matrices as if they were unstructured and utilizing the standard operation

```
toch.matmul(A_t, x_t_minus_1)
```

The second submodule (time_series_JAX) provides a JAX implementation which utilizes an efficient parallel associative scan function.
